## Project: Nuudle

Nuudle is a **desktop app for managing patient records and clinic appointments, optimized for use
via a Command Line Interface**(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Nuudle can get your patient and appointment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
    * Assign feature which allows users to assign an appointment to a patient.
    * View feature which allows users to view all appointment on a specific date.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=zhangwanlin98&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=ZhangWanlin98&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

* **Project management**: none.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Enhanced find feature from finding by name to finding by name or phone number or NRIC, or any combination of them.
